//! <h1> Device GPIO Setup (GpioSetup)</h1>
//!
//! Configures the F2837xS GPIO into two different configurations
//! This code is verbose to illustrate how the GPIO could be setup.
//! In a real application, lines of code can be combined for improved
//! code size and efficiency.
//!
//! This example only sets-up the GPIO. Nothing is actually done with
//! the pins after setup.
//!
//! \b In \b general: \n
//!  - All pullup resistors are enabled.  For ePWMs this may not be desired.
//!  - Input qual for communication ports (eCAN, SPI, SCI, I2C) is asynchronous
//!  - Input qual for Trip pins (TZ) is asynchronous
//!  - Input qual for eCAP and eQEP signals is synch to SYSCLKOUT
//!  - Input qual for some I/O's and __interrupts may have a sampling window
