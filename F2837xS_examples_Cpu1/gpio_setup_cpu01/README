Device GPIO Setup (GpioSetup)

 Configures the F2837xS GPIO into two different configurations.
 This code is verbose to illustrate how the GPIO could be setup.
In a real application, lines of code can be combined for improved
code size and efficiency.

This example only sets-up the GPIO. Nothing is actually done with
the pins after setup.

 \b In \b general: 
  - All pullup resistors are enabled.  For ePWMs this may not be desired.
  - Input qual for communication ports (eCAN, SPI, SCI, I2C) is asynchronous
  - Input qual for Trip pins (TZ) is asynchronous
  - Input qual for eCAP and eQEP signals is synch to SYSCLKOUT
  - Input qual for some I/O's and __interrupts may have a sampling window
